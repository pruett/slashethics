With technology playing an ever-increasing role in our daily lives, it's important we consider the various ethical concerns raised as a result. The `/ethics` (slashethics) initiative provides an authoritative place for entities to broadcast their ethical considerations regarding the technology they build and deploy to the world.

## What are the goals of the `/ethics` initiative? 

1. Define and discuss ethical [issues](#issues) related to today's technology
2. Provide an authoritative place (/ethics URL) to share views on such issues

## Issues

Below is a working list of various ethical issues technology builders may encounter. Feel free to post questions, related links, personal experiences, etc. in the comment threads. We want to encourage an open but friendly discourse surrounding these often complicated topics.
