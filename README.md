With technology playing an ever-increasing role in our daily lives, it's important we consider the various ethical questions raised as a result. The `/ethics` (slashethics) initiative provides an authoritative place for entities to broadcast their ethical considerations regarding the technology they build and deploy to the world.  

## What are the goals of the `/ethics` initiative?
